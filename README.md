This is my project for BTU EXAM
in these SPA web app  user can sign in and create quiz and post it(Crud your own quiz post)  (needs admin approve to post, which is user id = 1) , see all quiz and take it,
when you take quiz as normal web you can see it is correct answer or not

this is how looks like ! 
![this is admin page (user id = 1 ) where he/ she can see what users posted and approve or not , also delete it (Admin is a Boss :))]
